/*-creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR! There are many versions of the game WAR. In this version there are only 2 players.
-You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a round.
-Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. 
-Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods they may include. 
-You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your code, the entire game should play out instantly without any user input inside of your browser‚Äôs console.
--The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
-Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
-Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
-The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
-Ties result in zero points for both Players
-After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
-Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.
